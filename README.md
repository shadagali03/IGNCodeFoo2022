# IGNCodeFoo2022
Application for IGN Code Foo 2022

For this challenge I selected to do challege One(front end). Things I have learned from experience is better use of API calling, I effectively used the contents of the data that made the design look elegant. I also learned a lot about css styling, while I had some experience before hand, I face many challenges regarding centering divs and making sure alignments were correct. Some things that I did not do so well were figuring out how to style the video play buttons. There were a lot of complications when I tried implementing them, and since they looked worse than the default setting, I decided to go with the regular one. Another issue I ran into was dealing with Safari, the API was unable to pass through as I was experiencing cors issues. Therefore, the site only works with Google Chrome and Firefox. I published the website to GitHub Pages so feel free to check it out there.

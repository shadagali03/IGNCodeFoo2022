<h1><u>Hisui's New Power Plant</u></h1>
<h2>Solution</h2>
Important Information:

- Jubilife Village needs to create a new power plant to help run the city
- Pokemon Voltorb is best suited to run the plant
- Voltorb dimensions: .5m and 10.4kg
- Voltorb is uncommon and only found in Sacred Plaza

Objective: How many Voltorbs will you need to catch to fully power the village

Plan:

Research the important information and key terms

- Jubilife Village
- Voltorb
- Uncommon
- Sacred Plaza

Calculate the necessary amount of Voltorbs needed to power the village

- How much power does Jubilife City need?
- How much power can a single Voltorb produce

Divide power needed and amount of power a voltorb can produce to find total Voltorbs

Extra Thoughts:

- Figure out how to catch the necessary amount of Voltorbs efficiently and humanely
- Questions to consider
  - Will catching the Voltorbs harm their well being?
  - How does it affect the Sacred Villages ecosystem

Implementation:

Key Notes:

- Assume all data points and listings refer to Pokemon Platinum as different game versions have different statistics regarding city population, pokemon dimensions and location

Research

Jubilife Village:

- Population size 124
- Voltorb:
  - Catch rate 35.2%
  - Commonly found near power plants
  - Growth rate is medium fast
- Power Plants
  - Although unable to find a definite amount of energy units required to power a plant it was found that 6 Voltorbs were located at the Northeast Carbos Plant
- Sacred Plaza
  - Voltorbs can be found all day at any weather conditions
  - Located in Coronet Highlands
  - One district from Jubilife Village

Energy:

- Voltors move thunderbol can produce over 100,000 volts
- It has been estimated by Alternative Energies, that a single household uses about 1000 kWh(kilo watt hours) per month
- Better approximation is about 5000 watts per second
- Modern house is rated around 15-20 amp circuit

Calculations:

Assume average family size is 4 people  Juibilife Village Population / Average family size = 124/4 = 31 households

Number of households in Jubilife Village Average energy consumption  31 x 1000 = 31000kWh per month and 372kWh per year

Thunderbolt(volts) x amp  100000 x 17 = 1,700,000 watts or 1700kW for every thunderbolt

If a voltorb were to be able to hold the thunderbolt for an entire hour it would be able produce 1700kW.


Conclusion:
A single voltorb thunderbolt can more produce more than enough energy to run Jubilife Village, however, it is unreasonable for us to assume that the voltorb would be able to sustain a thunderbolt for an hour. It would be more reasonable to get 60 Voltorbs and have them all thunderbolt once. This would allow for them to reach a 1700kWh, and this would allow for Jubilife to sustain for 4 years without having to need another thunderbolt. Voltorbs generally live in power plants so there is a chance that they would migrate to the new power plant after some time. Also, since Voltorbs are uncommon to increase your chances of catching them you could use better pokeballs such as the Ultra Ball or the best is the Master Ball.

My thought process throughout this activity was to think out each step and take one problem at a time. Knowing little about Pokemon, I decided to research facts about the different locations and pokemons. I then used that information as well as logic to come up with an effective/efficient solution.

<h2>Coding Challenge Prompt One</h2>
For this challenge I selected to do challenge One(front end). Things I have learned from experience is better use of API calling, I effectively used the contents of the data that made the design look elegant. I also learned a lot about css styling, while I had some experience before hand, I face many challenges regarding centering divs and making sure alignments were correct. Some things that I did not do so well were figuring out how to style the video play buttons. There were a lot of complications when I tried implementing them, and since they looked worse than the default setting, I decided to go with the regular one. Another issue I ran into was dealing with Safari, the API was unable to pass through as I was experiencing cors issues. Therefore, the site only works with Google Chrome and Firefox. I published the website to GitHub Pages so feel free to check it out there.

<h1><u>Hisui's New Power Plant</u></h1>
<h2>Solution</h2>
Important Information: 
* Jubilife Village needs to create a new power plant to help run the city
* Pokemon Voltorb is best suited to run the plant
* Voltorb dimensions: .5m and 10.4kg
* Voltorb is uncommon and only found in Sacred Plaza

Objective: How many Voltorbs will you need to catch to fully power the village

<h3>Plan</h3>
Research the important information and key terms
* Jubilife Village
* Voltorb
* Uncommon
* Sacred Plaza
* Calculate the necessary amount of Voltorbs needed to power the village
* How much power does Jubilife City need?
* How much power can a single Voltorb produce
* Divide power needed and amount of power a voltorb can produce to find total Voltorbs

<h3>Extra Thoughts</h3>
* Figure out how to catch the necessary amount of Voltorbs efficiently and humanely
Questions to consider
* Will catching the Voltorbs harm their well being?
* How does it affect the Sacred Villages ecosystem

<h3>Implementation</h3>
Key Notes:
Assume all data points and listings refer to Pokemon Platinum as different game versions have different statistics regarding city population, pokemon dimensions and location

<h3>Research</h3>
Jubilife Village:
* Population size 124
 Voltorb:
* Catch rate 35.2%
* Commonly found near power plants
* Growth rate is medium fast
Power Plants
* Although unable to find a definite amount of energy units required to power a plant it was found that 6 Voltorbs were located at the Northeast Carbos Plant
Sacred Plaza
* Voltorbs can be found all day at any weather conditions
* Located in Coronet Highlands
* One district from Jubilife Village
Energy
* Voltorb's move thunderbolt -> can produce over 100,000 volts
* It has been estimated by Alternative Energies, that a single household uses about 1000 kWh(kilo watt hours) per month
* Better approximation is about 5000 watts per second
* Modern house is rated around 15-20 amp circuit

<h3>Calculations</h3>
Assume average family size is 4 people -> Juibilife Village Population / Average family size = 124/4 = 31 households
Number of households in Jubilife Village * Average energy consumption -> 31 * 1000 = 31000kWh per month and 372kWh per year
Thunderbolt(volts) * amp -> 100000 * 17 = 1,700,000 watts for every thunderbolt






Conclusion:
After all the research done, I do not believe that I could make a conclusive answer. However, a possible solution would be for the Professor to build a Power Plant and just wait for some time. Voltorbs generally live in power plants so there is a chance that they would migrate to the new power plant after some time. Also, since Voltorbs are uncommon to increase your chances of catching them you could use better pokeballs such as the Ultra Ball or the best is the Master Ball. 

My thought process throughout this activity was to think out each step and take one problem at a time. Knowing little about Pokemon, I decided to research facts about the different locations and pokemons. I then used that information as well as logic to come up with an effective/efficient solution.

For this challenge I selected to do challenge One(front end). Things I have learned from experience is better use of API calling, I effectively used the contents of the data that made the design look elegant. I also learned a lot about css styling, while I had some experience before hand, I face many challenges regarding centering divs and making sure alignments were correct. Some things that I did not do so well were figuring out how to style the video play buttons. There were a lot of complications when I tried implementing them, and since they looked worse than the default setting, I decided to go with the regular one. Another issue I ran into was dealing with Safari, the API was unable to pass through as I was experiencing cors issues. Therefore, the site only works with Google Chrome and Firefox. I published the website to GitHub Pages so feel free to check it out there.
